i have a theory that when youre using safaricom wifi and your sim is also safaricom they somehow intentionally make your wifi shitty so you can switch to data then as soon as you finish your data the wifi is good again

this story for kra tapping into safaricom systems to monitor mpesa can be the biggest hurdle safaricom have infront of them even though gok is a shareholder they will mess up that company if they get access so many things can go wrong with this story
      plus i believe safaricom is already paying taxes aggressive and exorbitant tax policies will only push the common mwananchi not to believe in this uda administration president ruto should go for corrupt government officials they know where the money is

      true this so called monitoring will lead to double taxation safaricom mpesa are taxed as well as businesses that have to disclose their revenue quarterly even those via paybill  to go again and look at those los and think wow i need to tax this mone again is unbeleivable
the market turned green following its ninesession bear run climbing  on the price recovery of safaricom similarly the nse  and nse  ticked up  and  respectively  
    unlikely that govt will let a company they have significant stake in and one that is important nationally be run over plus safaricom and starlink may end up complementing each other and having a strategic partnership in certain areas may be opportunities for saf in space tech
    true this so called monitoring will lead to double taxation arent safaricom mpesa are taxed as well as businesses that have to disclose their revenue quarterly even those via paybill  to go again and look at those los and think wow i need to tax this mone again is unbeleivable
  you can also try to retrieve the statement via the link  og

  thought was alone on this issue electricity has become expensive and since allowing payments to be done via safaricom paybill it is now apparent they are silently stealing from kenyans everyday it is the fuel levy and other irrelevant deductions that seem to increase by the day
    our daily withdrawal limits isksh  safaricom  which is accessed by making  sets of withdrawals worth ksh  twice and  ksh  while between midnight and am is ksh note daily means every  hourseo
my joy is to see others move to the next level     if implemented correctly it might bring longterm profits for the companywhat if we upgrade our mpesa app for better services to the clients mostly by eliminating cases of theft during transactions

safaricom needs to innovate to survive the telecommunications landscape is changing fast many of the young customers hardly know what an sms is
i do not see any reason why safaricom limits mpesa to its telecommunications customers this is the model they should use when they launch mpesa services in ethiopia
mpesa should be delinked from safaricom while remaining its full subsidiary that way mpesa can become network agnostic which will allow anyone with a mobile phone to operate an mpesa account
safaricom should therefore consider the idea of turning mpesa into a fullfledged digital bank they should seek a banking license from cbk they should also seek full licenses from cma ira and rba
why mpesa should transition into a bank safaricom needs to keenly observe what is going on in the banking system we are entering the era of fullfledged digital banks

    there have been victims of accidental buying of airtime when they really intended to do a different transactionso i think the extra buy airtime step is to be reminded that you are actually buying airtime and not sending money to someone for example

n make sure that you can only replace your sim card at a safaricom care shop and not at mpesa agents the shops have an added layer of security that you cannot find at an mpesa outlet
n after doing that make sure you report the fraudulent number by forwarding it to  safaricom will investigate its authenticity and ban it from its network
n safaricom will only call you on  any other number is not owned by safaricom customer care agents and is likely attempting to scam you just take extra care and verify which number is calling you
  what is happening with paypal mpesa withdrawal     
n you should only reach out verified safaricom handles on twitter and facebook they will have a blue checkmarkreport fake handles that try to ask  for personal details such as your phone numbers and pins for additional assistance

elon musk is bringing a new telecommunication service to kenya called starlink  i mean i definitely welcome the competition  safaricom has been giving us hard time they rip us off every day  can we get another one to also compete with kplc we need to break the monopoly

      be vigilant i have also noticed nowadays ukituma pesa wrong number it is like safaricom calls the guy alitumiwa pesa and they strike a deal then safcom tells  you back pesa ilishatumika and you you will never see your reversal
  using your app has become exhaustingits too busymany steps involved just for a simple transaction and its crazy that your mpesa transaction charges are double what safaricom chargesnot sustainable in these harsh economic times

  hey am call paul amugavo a form four leaver and am looking for a job so that i can help my family
  kindly explain to how this ksh was used when i was a sleepsomething is not right 
  after your postpay revamp we are no longer able to share postpay data with other numbers the revamp bundles are not part of the options you get when sharing is this intentional
  good morningthis hr bundle should take how long as i wait   
  which shop in nairobi currently has the esim in stockthats open today ofcoursenot available in saritwestgatewapi
  you will be notified soon iz
    infact safaricom went ahead and told there was no money sent to her on the th or even to dateof such amountsthis makes us think you guys are just trying to con her out of her moneyand she is really using alot of time and resources to follow up   
      especially the mpesa business app it sucks    
    this is okyou gave her a mpesa code and asked her to follow up with safaricomwhen she called them they said the code she was given was for a transaction that she did on th but what we are following up on a transaction done on the ththis looks suspect    
    this is selfish and i pray that this program should stop he is using one rogue employee called dkanyi to do magics and being paid peanuts for that matterselfish and useless braggarts
  sorry not the gold g costs ksh  which is  gb see heregtgt  ao
whoelse did a bc from   and got a message that transaction failed but the account balance is debited the cash reversed is also not equal to the debited balance who is stealing from who     or  
          watch out your rogue employee dkanyihe is being paid to shut down peoples paybills and businesses with no evidence he should be summoned and kenyans must know him very unpreffesional fellow
from the way they h  been adjusting the validity  periods of bundles and redeemed bonga downwards      are actually suffering from

   dear saf saf home fibre kasarani area has been extremely troublesome past couple of days what is up with that cannot play my online games see attached image of frequent packet timeouts accnt  
how long does it take   to transfer your line from prepaid to postpaid
      no interest whatsoever in solving customers problems and issues  that r mostly usually caused by the same incompetence at safaricom they only care about proving a point and being right in their own grandiose opinioni think the ceo and all senior management should step down
      it is really sad to see a once good company go to the dogs  in real timeyou have incompetent people on the other side of these communication channels of the socalled customer service they do not understand or care about the human element they act like incompetent robots

    i have been dealing with an issue since august and nobody over there has the inclination to help me work it out what a useless companyi still cannot access my  accounts and government services because you are playing these childish games ceo     ought to be ashamed
    im trying to call you people on  and its telling me the number is out of service my internet connection has been terrible for the past few weeks acc  fix it
  customer service    is non existent makes you miss the days of michael joseph when the workers over there actually valued the customers who pay their salaries
      since they enjoy monopoly theyll answer when they feel like they have worst customer service and day light robbers
